# machine_learning_metal_surface_defection
It's an IEEE project of our college NITK. We aim to create a machine learning classification model from real-world industry data to detect defect on a metal surface .

# THE CODE IS DONE, BUT I'M LAZY TO PUSH, ALSO SOME MAJOR IMPROVEMENTS NEEDED TO MAKE IT RUN LIKE A HORSE ;) now it's just walking.
## Would be soon done & I plan to DEPLOY IT AS WEBAPP, STAY TUNED ;)
